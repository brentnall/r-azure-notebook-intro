# Introduction to R Notebooks

This is a set of short tutorial files designed to introduce you to using R notebooks. It is based on running [Jupyter Notebooks](#jupyter) using [Microsoft Azure](https://notebooks.azure.com). 

Notebooks such as Jupyter are a way to combine code, images, text, graphs, all in one format. They help ensure that analysis and research is reproducible.

# Summary of contents 

There are three notebooks to work through. The following order is recommended.

1. 'Introduction to R.ipynb'. This introduces the statistical software R, and use in a Jupyter notebook.
1. 'DataAnalysis.ipynb'. This introduces some basic statistical analysis in R.
1. 'CreateNotebook.ipynb'. This shows you how to create your own project and notebook.
