# Introduction to R Notebooks

This is a short introduction to using R notebooks. It uses [Jupyter Notebooks](#jupyter) and was originally developed to be run on the cloud via [Microsoft Azure](https://notebooks.azure.com). 

Notebooks such as Jupyter are a way to combine code, images, text, graphs, all in one format. They help ensure that analysis and research is reproducible.

# Summary of contents 

There are two notebooks to work through.
- 'Introduction to R.ipynb'. This introduces the statistical software R, and use in a Jupyter notebook.
- 'DataAnalysis.ipynb'. This introduces some basic statistical analysis in R.
